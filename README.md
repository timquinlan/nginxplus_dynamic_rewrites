# nginxplus_dynamic_rewrites

This demo requires an NGINX+ repository key and cert (the build will fail if the files are not in place). Place the .key and .crt files in ./plus-build of this repo before running docker-compose. If you are not a current NGINX+ customer, you can request a free 30-day trial at https://www.nginx.com/free-trial-request/

In addition to the key/cert you will need:

* docker, docker-compose
* authorization to build containers
* authorization to forward host ports
* ports 80 through 83 open on your host. If you need to change the ports you can modify docker-compose.yaml

Clone this repo and use docker-compose to bring up the environment:


    git clone https://github.com/timquinlan/nginxplus_dynamic_rewrites
    cp nginx-repo.crt nginx-repo.key nginxplus_dynamic_rewrites/plus-build
    cd nginxplus_dynamic_rewrites
    docker-compose up

The most common way to manage rewrites is with a map. This method is robust but static; any changes to the map will require a reload.  This demo explores using the NGINX+ keyvalue store to store rewrite info. I chose the keyvalue store since one can create/update/remove entries on the fly with an api call.  The demo is a docker-compose instance that spins up just one node, that node has multiple virtual servers that do different things.  Before moving forward, you must populate the keyvalue stores with the appropriate test data.  These commands populates three separate keyvalue zones: rewrites, timebounds and csv_data.  Rewrites is used in the first scenario, rewrites and timebounds are used in the second scenario and csv_data is used in the third scenario.


    curl -s -X POST -d '{"/abc":"/rewritten"}' localhost/api/8/http/keyvals/rewrites
    curl -s -X POST -d '{"/def":"/rewritten"}' localhost/api/8/http/keyvals/rewrites
    curl -s -X POST -d '{"/abc":"1996343255"}' localhost/api/8/http/keyvals/timebounds #expires on apr/5/2033
    curl -s -X POST -d '{"/def":"1680637655"}' localhost/api/8/http/keyvals/timebounds #expired on apr/4/2023
    curl -s -X POST -d '{"/abc":"/rewritten,1649277630,1996343255"}' localhost/api/8/http/keyvals/csv_data #valid from apr/6/2022 until apr/5/2033
    curl -s -X POST -d '{"/def":"/rewritten,1649277630,1680637655"}' localhost/api/8/http/keyvals/csv_data #valid from apr/6/2022 until apr/4/2023
    curl -s -X POST -d '{"/xyz":"/rewritten,1838666430,1996343255"}' localhost/api/8/http/keyvals/csv_data #valid from apr/6/2028 until apr/5/2033 

Use the NGINX+ API to check the keyvalue stores are populated:


    $ curl -s localhost/api/8/http/keyvals | jq
        {
          "csv_data": {
            "/abc": "/rewritten,1649277630,1996343255",
            "/def": "/rewritten,1649277630,1680637655",
            "/xyz": "/rewritten,1838666430,1996343255"
          },
          "timebounds": {
            "/abc": "1996343255",
            "/def": "1680637655"
          },
          "rewrites": {
            "/abc": "/rewritten",
            "/def": "/rewritten"
          }
        }

**Virtual Server Overview and Test Cases**

**Port 88:** acts as an upstream for the other servers to proxy_pass to. You won't interact with it directly.

**Port 80:** uses an if statement before any content handling to evaluate if there is a rewrite entry in the keyvalue store, if there is it will rewrite the URI to the new value.  I included this to show that it can be done with out any additional logic beyond what is available in  normal nginx directives.  


    keyval_zone zone=rewrites:1m;
    keyval $uri $newuri zone=rewrites;

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name localhost;
    
        if ($newuri) {
           rewrite ^(.*)$ $newuri last;
        }
    
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://local_upstream;
        }
    
        location /rewritten {
            return 200 "this is the rewritten location\n";
        }
    
        location /api {
            # don't use this in prod without adding some security!!!
            api write=on;
        }
    }

We created a keyvalue zone called rewrites and populated it with entries for /abc and /def.  The following test cases apply to this virtual server:


    $ curl localhost:80/
    content handled by proxy_pass
    $ curl localhost:80/abc
    this is the rewritten location
    $ curl localhost:80/def
    this is the rewritten location

**Port 81:** prior to any content handling it uses NJS to evaluate the keyvalue stores, if there is a rewrite present for the current URI it will check the timebounds keyvalue store and evaluate if the rewrite has has expired or not.  

The njs for this example is called on every request.  The dyn_rewrite function checks the rewrites keyval zone, if there is no rewrite for the current uri it sets $evaluate_rewrite to 0, causing nginx to bypass the if statemnets and continue on its normal flow of content handling.  If there is a rewrite for the current uri it checks the timebounds keyval zone and determines if the rewrite is not expired.  If the rewrite timebound is in the future, it sets $evaluate_rewrite to 1 which will execute a rewrite to the defined uri. If the rewrite timebound is in the past it sets $evaluate_rewrite to 2 which will execute a rewrite to the /expired location.


    function dyn_rewrite(r) {
        if (r.variables.newuri) {
             const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
             if (now < r.variables.epochtimeout) {
                 return(1);
             } else if (now >= r.variables.epochtimeout) {
                 return(2);
             }
        }
        return(0); //catch all
    }
    
    export default {dyn_rewrite}

The nginx.conf for this method is similar to the previous example.  It uses the keyvalue zone (rewrites) from the previous example plus a keyval zone called timebounds, a js_set call and two if statements:



    keyval_zone zone=timebounds:1m;
    keyval $uri $epochtimeout zone=timebounds;

    keyval_zone zone=rewrites:1m;
    keyval $uri $newuri zone=rewrites;
    
    server {
        listen 81;
    
        js_import /etc/nginx/njs/dyn_rewrite.js;
        js_set $evaluate_rewrite dyn_rewrite.dyn_rewrite;
    
        if ($evaluate_rewrite = 1) {
           rewrite ^(.*)$ $newuri last;
        }
    
        if ($evaluate_rewrite = 2) {
           rewrite ^(.*)$ /expired last;
        }
    
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://local_upstream;
        }
    
        location /rewritten {
            return 200 "this is the rewritten location\n";
        }
    
        location /expired {
            return 200 "that rewrite is expired\n";
        }
    
        location /api {
            # don't use this in prod without adding some security!!!
            api write=on;
        }
    }

We created a keyvalue zone called rewrites and populated it with entries for /abc and /def.  We also created a keyvalue zone called timebounds and set /abc's timebound as sometime in the distant future, and set /def's timebound as sometime in the past. The following test cases apply to this virtual server:


    $ curl localhost:81/
    content handled by proxy_pass
    $ curl localhost:81/abc
    this is the rewritten location
    $ curl localhost:81/def
    that redirect is expired

**Port 82:** this example stores data in the keyvalue zone in a csv format. Each entry includes the new uri, the start time and expire time. Prior to any content handling it uses NJS to evaluate the keyvalue store, if there is an entry present for the current URI it will split the csv data up to determine if the current time is between the start and expiry time and set the rewrite uri.

NJS called twice every request in this example.  The csv_rewrite function checks the csv_data keyval zone, and determinse if the current time is between the start and expire time of the rewrite.  If so, it sets evaluate_rewrite to 1, triggering a rewwrite.  If the current time is after the expiry time it sets evaluate_rewrite to 2, triggering a rewrite to the /expired location.  If there is no entry, or the current time is before the start time, evaluate_rewrite is set to 0 causing nginx to bypass the if statemnets and continue on its normal flow of content handling.  Each request also checks the set_uri function.  This is only actually required if evaluate_rewrite is set to 1, however since js_set cannot be placed in an if statement, set_uri gets called whether it is needed or not. 


    function csv_rewrite(r) {
        if (r.variables.csv_data) {
             const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
             let fields = r.variables.csv_data.split(",");
             let start = fields[1];
             let expire = fields[2];
             if (start <= now && now <= expire ) {
                 return(1);
             } else if (now >= expire) {
                 return(2);
             }
        }
        return(0); //catch all
    }
    
    function set_uri(r) {
        if (r.variables.csv_data) {
           let fields = r.variables.csv_data.split(",");
           return(fields[0]);
        }
        return;
    }
    
    export default {csv_rewrite, set_uri}


The nginx.conf for this method is similar to the previous example, but has an additional js_set call to define and store a new variable called $uri_from_csv. 


    keyval_zone zone=csv_data:1m;
    keyval $uri $csv_data zone=csv_data;

    server {
        listen 82;
    
        js_import /etc/nginx/njs/csv_rewrite.js;
        js_set $evaluate_rewrite csv_rewrite.csv_rewrite;
        js_set $uri_from_csv csv_rewrite.set_uri;
    
        if ($evaluate_rewrite = 1) {
           rewrite ^(.*)$ $uri_from_csv last;
        }
    
        if ($evaluate_rewrite = 2) {
           rewrite ^(.*)$ /expired last;
        }
    
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://local_upstream;
        }
    
        location /rewritten {
            return 200 "this is the rewritten location\n";
        }
    
        location /expired {
            return 200 "that redirect is expired\n";
        }
    
        location /api {
            # don't use this in prod without adding some security!!!
            api write=on;
        }
    }


 
We created a keyvalue zone csv_data and populated it with entries for /abc, /def and /xyz.  The csv_data also include start and expiry times for each entry.  The entry for /abc is valid from apr/6/2022 until apr/5/2033, this is a valid rewrite. The entry for /def is valid from apr/6/2022 until apr/4/2023, this is an expired rewrite.  /xyz is valid from apr/6/2028 until apr/4/2023, this rewrite is not yet valid, the logic will simply ignore it and proceed with the normal content handling:


    $ curl localhost:82
    content handled by proxy_pass
    $ curl localhost:82/abc
    this is the rewritten location
    $ curl localhost:82/def
    that redirect is expired
    $ curl localhost:82/xyz
    content handled by proxy_pass


**Port 83:** this will combine the dynamic rewrites from the previous example with a more traditional static rewrite map. This combined method would keep the permanent rewrites in the map, and reserve the dynamic rewrite zones for temporary or newly added entries.  This combines the flexibility to dynamically add/remove/update rewrites to the smallest zone possible while storing permanent rewrites in a more traditional, static manner. 

uses the same NJS and KV as :82, adds a map and an new if statement before the NJS/KV part.  The map should be a separate include file for ease of manamgemen

    map $request_uri $map_uri {
       default "";
       /123 /rewritten;
       /456 /rewritten;
    }

    keyval_zone zone=csv_data:1m;
    keyval $uri $csv_data zone=csv_data;
    
    server {
        listen 83;
    
        if ($map_uri) {
           rewrite ^(.*)$ $map_uri last;
        }
    
        js_import /etc/nginx/njs/csv_rewrite.js;
        js_set $evaluate_rewrite csv_rewrite.csv_rewrite;
        js_set $uri_from_csv csv_rewrite.set_uri;
    
        if ($evaluate_rewrite = 1) {
           rewrite ^(.*)$ $uri_from_csv last;
        }
    
        if ($evaluate_rewrite = 2) {
           rewrite ^(.*)$ /expired last;
        }
    
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://local_upstream;
        }
    
        location /rewritten {
            return 200 "this is the rewritten location\n";
        }
    
        location /expired {
            return 200 "that redirect is expired\n";
        }
    
        location /api {
            # don't use this in prod without adding some security!!!
            api write=on;
        }
    
        location = /dashboard.html {
            root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        }
    }
